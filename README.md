# VIP Go Skeleton

The repo is a starting point for building your VIP Go site. It includes all the base folders that you need to build on.

To learn more, please see https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/vip-go/understanding-your-vip-go-codebase/

## Usage

All the directories here are required and will be available on production web servers. Any extra directories will not be available in production.

### Continuous Integration

If you have requested to use VIP Go [automated build](https://vip.wordpress.com/documentation/automated-build-and-deploy-on-vip-go/) for your assets (JS & CSS)
and/or for pre-deploy testing,
a [starter CircleCI configureation](.circleci/config.yml) may be modified to fit your objectives.

If CI has been set up, a CI/CD readme should be in your [master-built](../blob/master-built/build/) branch already.

Any sample CI configuration files that you do not need may be deleted.
