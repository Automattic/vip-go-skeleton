# WordPress VIP Skeleton Application

Welcome to WordPress VIP! This repository is a starting point for building your WordPress VIP application, including all the base directories.

# Codespaces Preview

This is a preview/discovery version of using Codespaces for spinning up VIP-compatible environments.

On GitHub, go to the repos and Press the code button, and press "create codespace on preview/dev-container".

1. Start the codespace.
1. Wait until it builds and fully initalizes.
1. Wait until the UI fully connects.
1. Open Ports tab.
1. Click a globe icon to open the preview URL in the browser.

## Preview limitations

1. You'll get the default clean database.
1. Elasticsearch is commented out, it works but needs a heavier machine class (4 cores, 8GB RAM minimum)
1. Things may break as we tinker.

## Guidebooks

We recommend starting with one of the following WordPress VIP guidebooks:

* [Local development for a WordPress VIP application](https://docs.wpvip.com/how-tos/local-development/)
* [Development workflow for WordPress VIP](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/development-workflow/)
* [Launching a site with WordPress VIP](https://docs.wpvip.com/how-tos/launch-a-site/)

## Directories

All the following directories are required and must not be removed:

* `client-mu-plugins/`: For [always active global plugins](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/vip-codebase/client-mu-plugins-directory/) (similar to `mu-plugins`).
* `docs/`: Not mounted to production, so [useful for storing documentation](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/vip-codebase/docs-directory/) about an applications features and requirements.
* `images/`: Store [your site's favicons](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/vip-codebase/images-directory/) here. All other public-facing images should be uploaded or [imported](https://docs.wpvip.com/how-tos/launch-a-site-with-vip/launch-with-vip-migrate-content/) to the WordPress dashboard or stored as part of your `/theme/` assets.
* `languages/`: For [`.po` and `.mo` translation files](https://docs.wpvip.com/how-tos/upload-languages-to-the-language-directory/), which specify the translated strings for the site.
* `plugins/`: Your site's [regular plugins](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/vip-codebase/plugins-directory/).
* `private/`: Provides access to [files that are not directly web accessible](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/vip-codebase/private-directory/), but can be accessed by your theme or plugin code.
* `themes/`: [Themes available to your sites](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/vip-codebase/themes-on-vip-go/). We recommend keeping the default theme available for [testing purposes](https://docs.wpvip.com/how-tos/prepare-for-site-launch/testing-your-site/).
* `vip-config/`: For [custom configurations](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/vip-codebase/vip-config-directory/) and additional [`sunrise.php` changes](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/multisites/sunrise-php/). This folderâ€™s `vip-config.php` can be used to supply things usually found in `wp-config.php`..

These directories will also be available on production web servers. Any additional directories created in your GitHub repository that are not included in the above list will not be mounted onto your site, and so will not be web-accessible.

For more information on how our codebase is structured, see https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/vip-codebase/. 

The `docs/` directory is a special directory that contains your documentation for your application. It is not mounted onto your site, but is available for you to use. See [docs/index.php](docs/index.php) for more information.

## PHPCS for checking coding standards

This repo contains a starting point for installing and using a _local_ version of [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://docs.wpvip.com/how-tos/php_codesniffer/) (PHPCS). To get started, you'll need to have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed, then open a command line at this directory, and run:

```sh
composer install
```

This will install PHPCS and register the below standards:

 - [VIP Coding Standards](https://github.com/Automattic/VIP-Coding-Standards)
 - [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards)
 - [PHPCompatibilityWP Standard](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibilityWP)

The [`.phpcs.xml.dist`](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/vip-codebase/phpcs-xml-dist/) file contains a _suggested_ configuration, but you are free to amend this. You can also [extend](https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/vip-codebase/phpcs-xml-dist/#h-extending-the-root-phpcs-xml-dist-file-for-custom-themes-and-plugins) it for more granularity of configuration for theme and custom plugins.

To run PHPCS, navigate to the directory where the relevant `.phpcs.xml.dist` lives, and type:

```sh
vendor/bin/phpcs
```

See the [PHPCS documentation](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Usage) (or run `phpcs -h`) for the available command line arguments.

## Support

If you need help with anything, VIP's support team is [just a ticket away](https://wpvip.com/accessing-vip-support/).

## Your documentation here

Feel free to add to or replace this README.md content with content unique to your project, for example:

* Project-specific notes; like a list of VIP environments and branches,
* Workflow documentation; so everyone working in this repo can follow a defined process, or
* Instructions for testing new features.

This can be detailed in the `docs/` directory.
