/**
 * Hi there, VIP dev!
 *
 * vip-config.php is where you put things you'd usually put in wp-config.php. Don't worry about database settings
 * and such, we've taken care of that for you. This is just for if you need to define an API key or something
 * of that nature.
 *
 * WARNING: This file is loaded very early (immediately after `wp-config.php`), which means that most WordPress APIs,
 *   classes, and functions are not available. The code below should be limited to pure PHP.
 *
 * @see https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/vip-codebase/vip-config-directory/
 *
 * Happy coding!
 *
 * - The WordPress VIP Team
